DESC BRIO

Say yeah 
Say Brio, okie smokie 
This dome's golden mined off blood of ancestors
Burma warrior descendant brief for World War II aesthetics
When Bungomek made him probably 2 years after 90s struck
EABL is Lord Brio Alpho Ekisa backwards
A simple flip of that monogram
Never soaked in alcohol either
Paragraphs sickled outside sicker than serin attacks
Might catch Dedan's ghost and start speaking in Mau Mau records
That boy 7 when rebellion acquiants
Dome is titanium now and other rare minerals
To find it they employ forensics
